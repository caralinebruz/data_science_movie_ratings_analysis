Data Science analysis project for movie ratings data


### Questions

1) Are movies that are more popular (operationalized as having more ratings) rated higher than movies that
are less popular? [Hint: You can do a median-split of popularity to determine high vs. low popularity movies]
2) Are movies that are newer rated differently than movies that are older? [Hint: Do a median split of year of
release to contrast movies in terms of whether they are old or new]
3) Is enjoyment of ‘Shrek (2001)’ gendered, i.e. do male and female viewers rate it differently?
4) What proportion of movies are rated differently by male and female viewers?
5) Do people who are only children enjoy ‘The Lion King (1994)’ more than people with siblings?
6) What proportion of movies exhibit an “only child effect”, i.e. are rated different by viewers with siblings
vs. those without?
7) Do people who like to watch movies socially enjoy ‘The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)’ more than those who
prefer to watch them alone?
8) What proportion of movies exhibit such a “social watching” effect?
9) Is the ratings distribution of ‘Home Alone (1990)’ different than that of ‘Finding Nemo (2003)’?
10) There are ratings on movies from several franchises ([‘Star Wars’, ‘Harry Potter’, ‘The Matrix’, ‘Indiana
Jones’, ‘Jurassic Park’, ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’, ‘Toy Story’, ‘Batman’]) in this dataset. How many of these
are of inconsistent quality, as experienced by viewers?[Hint: You can use the keywords in quotation marks
featured in this question to identify the movies that are part of each franchise]

Extra Credit: Tell us something interesting and true (supported by a significance test of some kind) about the
movies in this dataset that is not already covered by the questions above [for 5% of the grade score].
